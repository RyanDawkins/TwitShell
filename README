The application twitshell is an Command Line Interactive (CLI) application
written to communicate with the twitter API. This application would be
particularly useful for users or administrators who do not wish to run a
window manager or desktop manager and wish to update their twitter via the
command line. However, in order to set up the authorization you will need
a browser to get the key codes to connect to your account.

method of installation will need to be consulted by the corresponding systems
documentation. All commands will be written between quotes: ''

To install rubygems different commands will be used due to different package
management systems.

Due to the mass use of Ubuntu in the Linux community documentation will be provided.
For installation of "rubygems" you will need to run the following command:

'sudo apt-get install rubygems'

--------------
- Arch Linux -
--------------

Most users using the Arch Linux operating system most likely will not need the following
documentation in order to install the dependencies. However, with the great amount of
documentation that does already consist I will provide some just for the beauty of the
repository.

You must run the following command to install "rubygems"

'sudo pacman -S rubygems'

- Twitter API -
---------------

In order to use the application to work with twitter you must install the rubygem 'twitter'.
to install the gem you must type the following command:

'sudo gem install twitter'

------------

After installing "rubygems" and "twitter" you will have installed all of the necessary
dependencies in order to run the twitshell application. However, it is optional to
change the permissions of the "Shell.rb" file so that it can be executable. In order
to do so you must run the following command:

'sudo chmod 755 Shell.rb'
